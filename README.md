Answer the age old question of, "who has the game I'm thinking of gifting?!"

TODO
- [x] init npm project
- [x] script to convert separate csv's into a single JSON file
- [x] init Vue project
- [ ] the thing
  - include a `resources`-like folder to house the json file
  - depending on ease of set up for Vue cli, consider adding a simple server
    that houses the static app in a `dist-`like folder
- [ ] instructions for use
- [ ] how is the user-friendliness for set up??


## Instructions
1. Install Node.js
1. Export the BGG game collections as csv's, save them in the `resources`
    folder.
1. Run `npm start` to condense all of the player data into a single file
    (`resources/players.json`)
