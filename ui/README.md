## Running todo's
- [x] Fixed header
- [x] Simplify header (see GH, GMail as examples) - make the title less jumpy/prominent
- [ ] Spruce up the body
  - [x] verbiage
  - [x] make verbiage stand out for players matching search
  - [ ] Grid/flexbox the GameListItem's
    - show first 5 - 10 games in each GameListItem
    - min/max-width, -height  on each GameListItem
    - make expandable
  - [ ] margins for some whitespace on small viewports
- [ ] Test on desktop, mobile
- [ ] Replace "Avenir" with Roboto/other sans-serif typeface with progressive enhancement if
  typeface unavailable.
- [ ] Investigate `vue-mq` to expose media query breakpoints. Can this handle em's (if necessary)?
