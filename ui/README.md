# bgs3-ui

## UI future features
- [ ] Selectable participant filter.
  - e.g. `I want to see games owned by: <badges/list of selected people>`,
    including a mechanism option to add/remove people.
  - Addresses the case of, `I only want to see games owned by <person X>`.
- [ ] Test on desktop, mobile; fix any weirdness.
- [ ] Replace "Avenir" with Roboto/other sans-serif typeface with progressive enhancement if
  typeface unavailable.
- [ ] Investigate `vue-mq` to expose media query breakpoints. Can this handle em's (if necessary)?
