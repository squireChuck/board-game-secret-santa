## Running todo's
- [x] Fixed header
- [x] Simplify header (see GH, GMail as examples) - make the title less jumpy/prominent
- [ ] Spruce up the body - Grid/flexbox the GameListItem's
- [ ] Test on desktop, mobile
- [ ] Replace "Avenir" with Roboto/other sans-serif typeface with progressive enhancement if
  typeface unavailable.
- [ ] Investigate `vue-mq` to expose media query breakpoints. Can this handle em's (if necessary)?
